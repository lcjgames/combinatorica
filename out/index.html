<h2>How it fits the theme COMBINE</h2>
The game is inspired by combinatorics. If that's cheating for you, you also combine parts to make the ship.
<h2>How to Play</h2>
You are a great commander responsible for an asteroid mining operation.<br>
Your greatest asset is the <i>possibility engine</i>, which powers your fleet by accessing the multiverse and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics">combinatorics</a>.
<h3>Fleet Editor</h3>
Click on ships to add/remove them from the fleet.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination">Combinations</a> is the number of possible fleets with that number of ship.<br>
The combination number influences events, such as miraculously saving a ship by bringing in a copy from another universe, or increasing your chances of finding extra metal from the multiverse<br>
The plus button can be clicked if your have enough parts for a new ship<br>
<h3>Ship Editor</h3>
Select the parts you want.<br>
Your ship's strength will have a bonus based on the number of possible ships, which is calculated according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_product">rule of product</a>.<br>
The strength influences in-game calculations.<br>
<h3>Mining</h3>
Guide your pilots using the cursor. They are not very good pilots.<br>
The pilots will try to avoid each other. The ship won't be destroyed if they collide with each other.<br>
Get the ships close to the meteors to mine them with the laserguns. Don't get too close, though, or your ship will be lost forever.<br>
You can press Esc to exit, but you will lose your metal.<br>
After 60 seconds, the ships will come back with the metal, which will be automatically converted into random ship parts.<br>
